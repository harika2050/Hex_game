# Hex_game

The hex board is an 11x11 hexagonal tiling in a rhombus shape. Two players, Blue and Red, are assigned at opposite edges of the board. 
The board is empty in the beginning of the game, and the players must put the pieces, one by one. 
The goal for each player is to establish an unbroken chain with the own pieces connecting the two sides of the board marked with the own colour. In the implementation, one of the players is the computer.
